{"name":"Commentbox","tagline":"JSF commentary component","body":"# Commentbox\r\n\r\nThis is a jsf component that allows quick realization of a comment functionality with many features.\r\n\r\n![logo](https://raw.github.com/nickrussler/commentbox/master/misc/images/banner.png)\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/nickrussler/commentbox/master/misc/images/sample.png)\r\n\r\n## Promo Video\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZCklu-wI90\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Replies\r\n\r\nYou can reply to comments (and reply those, and so on).\r\n\r\n### Live Features\r\n\r\nOther users are notified on new comments, replies and when other users type.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n* Primefaces\r\n \r\n### Optional Dependencies\r\n\r\n* Primefaces push (Atmosphere framework) - You need this when you want to use the live features (enabled by default)\r\n* Add [prettyTime](http://ocpsoft.org/prettytime/) and [prettytime-integration-jsf](http://ocpsoft.org/prettytime/#section-6) to your project and commentbox will automatically use it to display time\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n[Here](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/nickrussler/job/commentbox/ws/source/target/commentbox-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) you can download the latest jar\r\n\r\n## Documetation\r\nDownload the documentation [here](https://github.com/nickrussler/commentbox/raw/master/misc/documentation.pdf).\r\n\r\n## First Steps\r\n\r\nI recomend to take a look at the [demo](https://github.com/nickrussler/commentbox/tree/master/demo-source) at first.\r\n\r\nJust deploy the demo project in any AS with eclipse or your IDE of choice, and try out some features!\r\n\r\n### Extended Demo\r\n\r\nAfter you played around with the demo you can start to use it immediatly or you can take a look at the [extended demo](https://github.com/nickrussler/commentbox/tree/master/extended-demo-source).\r\n\r\nIn the extended demo a real database is used via JPA.\r\n\r\nBecause of that you need to create a datasource (commentboxDS) in the configs of your AS or rename the used datasource to one of yours (in persistence.xml).\r\n\r\nThen deploy the demo project in any AS with eclipse or your IDE of choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notice for JBoss usage\r\nIn case you use JBoss and want to use the live features you need to adjust the standalone.xml to support atmosphere:\r\n\r\nchange the line:\r\n\r\n`<subsystem xmlns=\"urn:jboss:domain:web:1.1\" native=\"false\" [...]>`\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n`<subsystem xmlns=\"urn:jboss:domain:web:1.1\" native=\"true\" [...]>`\r\n\r\n## Why should i use it, i could use some external chat service?\r\n\r\n* You keep your data where it belongs, on your server !\r\n* Also you can (and are allowed to) make modifications to adapt to your special needs.\r\n* You can connect this component to your own user-system and your users don't need to have an account on your site and an additional account for the external system.\r\n\r\n##License\r\nThis project is open source and free, it is available under the [Apache v2 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n* Fugue Icons - Yusuke Kamiyamane - http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/\r\n* CLEditor YouTube Plugin v1.0.0 - Markus Horowski - http://www.terapix.de\r\n","google":"UA-39199818-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
